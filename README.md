# jovo-babel-project
An example project using Jovo Framework alongside JavaScript ES6.

## About
This is a simple _Hello, World!_ directory that will help you get you up and running with a maintainable [`jovo-framework`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jovo-framework) project as fast as possible.

This project inludes [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) for port tunnelling:
````
./node_modules/ngrok/bin/ngrok http 3000
````

Also contains a [session-based](https://www.jovo.tech/framework/docs/data#session-attributes) state-stack architecture for routing between asynchronous user requests.

## Thanks to
[Sheraz Sarwar](https://github.com/sheraz-sarwar) for his epic node.js refactoring.
